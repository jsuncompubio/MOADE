# MODE: Deep autoencoder for multi-omics tissue recovery deconvolution

This is a multimodal deep neural autoencoder framework that allows the input of more cell markers detectable in scRNA-seq reference and accounts for the between-tissue heterogeneity in target bulk data, without the requirement of feature annotation mapping across molecular modalities.
